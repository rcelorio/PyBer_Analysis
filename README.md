PyBer Analysis

## Objective 
Determine if there is a correlation between the average fare and the total rides for each city type for the individual scatter plots, and if there is any statistical significance between the different city types for each box-and-whisker plot. The goals for this challenge are:

* Use Pandas functions like groupby, pivot, resample, and reset_index on a DataFrame.
* Use Pandas methods and attributes on a DataFrame or Series.
* Create a new DataFrame from multiple groupby() Series.
* Format columns of a DataFrame.
* Create a multiple-line graph.
* Annotate and apply styling to the chart.
